# Blockchain Tic Tac Toe!

Learn Ethereum Smart Contracts by building and playing the tic tac toe game!

In this tutorial, we'll load a Solidity Tic Tac Toe game in the REMIX IDE, we'll deploy a Smart Contract and start playing against each other!

## Try out the Smart Contract

Open in REMIX IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/

1. Compile the Smart Contract
1. Use 1 account to deploy it, this will be player 1
1. Use a 2nd account to join the game, this will be player 2
1. Make your moves by calling the `play` method
1. Call `isWinner`/`isDraw` to check the status of the game

You may propose an alternative way to declare game over and a winner or dray.
You may build a Web UI on top for fun.
You may connect your Metamask and deploy to an actual blockchain to play against each other.
